// a Go string is a read-only slice of bytes
// the language and the startdad library treat strings specially - as containers of text encoded in UTF-8
// in other languages, strings are made of "characters"
// in Go, the concept of a character is called a rune - it's an integer that represents Unicode code point
// https://go.dev/blog/strings this go blog post is a good introduction to the topic

func main() {
	// s is a string assigned a literal value representing the word "hello" in the Thai language
	// Go string literals are UTF-8 encoded text
	const s string = "สวัสดี"

	// since strings are equivalent to []byte
	// this will produce the length of the raw bytes stored within
	fmt.Println("Len:", len(s))

	// indexing into a string produces the raw byte value at each index
	// this loop generates the hex values of all the bytes that constitute the code points in s
	for i := 0; i < len(s); i++ {

	// to count how many runes are in a string, we can use the utf8 package
	// note that the run-time of RuneCountInString depends on the size of the string
	// because it has to decode each UTF-8 rune sequentially
	// some Thai characters are represented by UTF-8 code points that can span multiple bytes
	// so the result of this count may be surprising
	fmt.Println("Rune count: ", utf8.RuneCountInString(s))

	// a range loop handles strings specially and decodes each rune along with its offset in the string
	for idx, runeValue := range s {

		runeValue, width := utf8.DecodeRuneInString(s[i:])

		w = width
